### This is a test post illustrating what can be done. 

### Everything can be done in normal markdown syntax. 

You can do inline math in the normal way $E = mc^{2}$ as you can see.

You can do nice display math using "$$"

$$E = mc^{2}$$


You can also include raw latex commands for more complex stuff using mathjax, katex, webtex and a whole load of other methods.


\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= x^2\\
  g(x) &= \frac{1}{x}\\
  F(x) &= \int^a_b \frac{1}{3}x^3
\end{align*}



### Tables

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |



### Display code with syntax highlighting

```python
1 + 1

#| echo: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.show()

```



### You can run code in python and R and JS

```{python}
#| echo: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.show()
```


### You can create tabsets 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Text 1 

This is stuff done in this language

## Image 2 

This is hopefully will be an image.

## Math 3

\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= x^2\\
  g(x) &= \frac{1}{x}\\
  F(x) &= \int^a_b \frac{1}{3}x^3
\end{align*}

### You can easily create dropdown callouts.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon=false collapse=true}

## Click me to expand

YAYAYAYAY

You can put whatever you like in here.

### It's simple to make different layouts and put whatever in them

::: {layout-ncol=2}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur gravida eu erat et fring. Morbi congue augue vel eros ullamcorper, eget convallis tortor sagittis. Fusce sodales viverra mauris a fringilla. Donec feugiat, justo eu blandit placerat, enim dui volutpat turpis.

\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= x^2\\
  g(x) &= \frac{1}{x}\\
  F(x) &= \int^a_b \frac{1}{3}x^3
\end{align*}

### Nice footnotes
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

##### Citations also work in a similar way and make it easy to handle - auto generate bibliography etc.

### You can also make images and visualisations span the whole page 

### You can also put things nicely in the margins



::: {.column-margin}
We know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
:::

Like so here we go. 
Things span the body by default but can be changed around very easily to span the full page.
