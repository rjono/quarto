    "text": "Problem\nThe following elegant pattern is observed:\n \n\\[\\begin{align}\n1+2&=3 \\\\\n4+5+6 &=7+8 \\\\\n9+10+11+12&=13+14+15 \\\\\n16+17+18+19+20&=21+22+23+24 \\\\\n25+26+27+28+29+30&=31+32+33+34+35 \\\\\n36+37+38+39+40+41+42&=43+44+45+46+47+48 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n \nEach line is formed by counting up the natural numbers , continuing the count of the previous line. Starting at \\([1+2=3]\\), each side of the equation has one more term than the previous line.\nWhy does this pattern occur and does it continue on forever?\n\n\nSolution\nThe first observation we can make is that each line begins with a square number. Do all equations in this format begin with a square number on the left side?\nFor a generic equation in this format: \\(A + (x+1) + (x+2) + \\cdots (x+n) = (x+n+1) +(x+n+2) + \\cdots (x +2n)\\)\nwe find that each term after \\(A\\) on the left hand side of the equation is \\(n\\) smaller than a corresponding term on the right hand side. Given there are \\(n\\) of these terms it follows that \\(A\\) must be \\(n^2\\)\nThe length of each line of the pattern can be expressed as \\(2n + 1\\) Given it counts up sequentially, the first number of each line is equal to the sum of all previous line lengths, \\(+1\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n1 +\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2k+1)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis can be rearranged as so:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n1 -(2n +1) +&\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k+1) \\\\\n=-2n +n +&\\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2k \\\\\n= -n + 2 \\cdot&\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k\n\\end{align}\\]\nGiven: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&n + 2(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}) \\\\\n=-&n +n^2 +n \\\\\n= \\space \\space \\space &n^2\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\((n-1)^2,\\  n^2,\\  (n+1)^2\\) depicts a generic sequence of squares. let \\(a\\) be the difference between \\(n^2\\) and \\((n-1)^2\\) and \\(b\\) be the difference between \\(n^2\\) and \\((n+1)^2\\)\nIf this is true, we should expect that the difference between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to be \\(2\\).\nIn equation format:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(n-1)^2 = n^2 + a = (n+1)^2 +a +b\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nthus:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na &= (n-1)^2 - n^2 \\\\\n&= n^2 - 2n +1 - n^2 \\\\\n&= - 2n +1 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\nb &= n^2 +a - ((n+1)^2 +a)\\\\\n&= n^2 +a -(n^2 +2n +1 +a) \\\\\n&= n^2 +a -n^2 -2n -1 -a) \\\\\n&= - 2n -1 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\na - b &= -2n +1 - (-2n-1) \\\\\n&= -2n +1 +2n +1 \\\\\n&= 2 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus the difference of the difference between adjacent squares is \\(2\\)\nThe general formula for any line \\(n\\) where line \\(n=1\\) is \\(1+2 =3\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn^2 + (n^2+1) + (n^2+2) + \\cdots (n^2+n) = (n^2+n+1)  + \\cdots (n^2 +2n)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=0}^n (n^2 +i) =  \\sum_{i=1}^n (n^2 +n+i)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nCubic sequence\nAs I was exploring the pattern to work out a proof, I stumbled upon the fact that the difference of the difference of the difference of the value of each line was constant.\nThe first line is made up of values of lines between \\(n=1\\) and \\(n=7\\). Each subsequent line is made up by taking the difference between the adjacent terms of the previous line \\[3\\qquad 15 \\qquad 42 \\qquad 90 \\qquad 165\\qquad 273\\qquad 420\\] \\[12\\qquad 27\\qquad 48\\qquad 75\\qquad 108\\qquad 147\\] \\[15\\qquad 21 \\qquad 27 \\qquad 33\\qquad 39\\] \\[6 \\qquad 6 \\qquad 6 \\qquad 6 \\]\nPolynomials of the degree \\(n\\) have a constant non-zero \\(n^{th}\\) difference, so the \\(3^{rd}\\) difference being constant \\(6\\) here is indicative of a cubic polynomial.\nFinding the formula for this sequence is a straightforward process of symultaneous equations, generated by using the general format of a cubic [\\(an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\\)] and equating it to the first four values in the sequence:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n1: \\quad&a + b + c + d = 3 \\\\\n2: \\quad&8a + 4b + 2c + d = 15 \\\\\n3: \\quad&27a + 9b + 3c + d = 42 \\\\\n4: \\quad&64a + 16b + 4c + d = 90 \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking equation \\(1\\) from \\(2\\) we eliminate \\(d\\): \\[\\begin{align}\n5: \\quad&7a +3b +c = 12\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking eq. \\(2\\) from \\(3\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n6: \\quad&19a +5b +c = 27\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking eq. \\(3\\) from \\(4\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n7: \\quad&37a +7b +c = 48\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking eq. \\(5\\) from \\(6\\) and eliminating \\(c\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n8: \\quad&12a +2b = 15\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking eq. \\(6\\) from \\(7\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n9: \\quad&18a +2b = 21\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking eq. \\(8\\) from \\(9\\) and eliminating \\(b\\) we get: \\[\\begin{align}\n6a &= 6 \\\\\na &= 1\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = 1\\) into eq. \\(8\\) we get \\[\\begin{align}\n12 +2b &= 15 \\\\\n2b &= 3 \\\\\nb &= \\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{2}\\) into eq. \\(5\\) we get: \\[\\begin{align}\n7 + \\frac{9}{2}+c &= 12\\\\\nc &= \\frac{24}{2} - \\frac{23}{2} \\\\\nc &= \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(c = \\frac{1}{2}\\) into eq. \\(1\\) we get:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nd &= 3 - 1 -\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nd &= 0\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus our formula for the \\(n^{th}\\) term is: \\[\\begin{align}\nn^3 + \\frac{3n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nWhere does this cubic come from?\nWe already determined that each line is given as: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=0}^n (n^2 +i) =  \\sum_{i=1}^n (n^2 +n+i)\n\\end{align}\\]\nTaking the right side of the equation, it can be rearranged as so:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (n^2 +n+i) \\\\\n= n^3 + n^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n (i) \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nGiven: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&n^3 + n^2 +(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}) \\\\\n= &n^3 + n^2 +\\frac{n^2 + n}{2} \\\\\n=&n^3 + \\frac{3n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}\n\\end{align}\\]"
